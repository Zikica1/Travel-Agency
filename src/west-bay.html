          <p>
            Less expensive than SMB or George Town, West Bay is popular for its
            broad choice in housing options and direct links to the Seven Mile
            Beach area.

              <h3>West Bay</h3>
              <p>
                West Bay is a residential neighbourhood at the top western end
                of the Island with a long meandering coastal road around the top
                of it and a maze of narrow streets running through the middle of
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will find stunning deserted beaches, an array of restaurants
                to enjoy and plenty of activities to keep the whole family
                entertained.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          There is a huge mix of different properties from luxury oceanfront
          homes and apartments, to island cottages and some rather rundown and
          tired properties in the middle. The canal-front area called The Shores
          commands premium prices on rentals and sales, as do properties on
          Boggy Sand Road, the last residential neighbourhood remaining on Seven
          Mile Beach. New developments like Dolphin Point Club, Oceans 9, Salt
          Air Townhomes, Serrana, The Meadows and ARZA add new life to West Bay
          and acclaimed restaurants such as Calypso Grill, Cracked Conch,
          Macabuca, Tukka West, Ristorante Pappagallo and VIVO offer nice
          options for lunch or an evening out. The Cayman Turtle Centre is in
          West Bay as is Cemetery Beach for amazing snorkelling, and the diving
          from the Cracked Conch restaurant and from Lighthouse Point nearby is
          also very popular. Divetech, the on-site dive shop at Lighthouse
          Point, is welcoming, and friendly staff can explain where nearby dive
          sites are located. They can also take you to the Kittiwake shipwreck.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can go horseback riding and bicycling along a rugged and
          little-travelled beach called Barkers, which spans part of the
          northern tip of West Bay. Barkers Beach is a nice area to get away
          from it all and is popular with dog walkers and kite surfers. Note the
          area is closed to vehicle and pedestrian traffic from sunset to
          sunrise. It currently takes about 10-15 minutes to drive from West Bay
          to George Town using the bypass.
